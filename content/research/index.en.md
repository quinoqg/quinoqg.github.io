My main research topics cover multi-scale experimentation and modelling of advanced composite and polymeric materials under dynamic loads and extreme working conditions such as humidity, cold/hot temperatures, and impact loading. The development of new and reliable manufacture and design tools for these materials, with applications on light, durable, shock-absorbing and corrosion-resistant structures, are paramount for a greener future. 

In the following sections, I describe my current and recent work under 4 main streams. You are invited to look at my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nDj_kT0AAAAJ&hl=en) for for an up-to-date list of my work.

## Compression of fibre composites
Fibre composites have an unveiled potential in compression. Currently their compression strength is normally around only 50% their tensile strength. In [NextCOMP](https://nextcomp.ac.uk/), we are developing the next generation of fibre composites, with improved compression performance. Improvements in their matrix, fibres, interfaces and architecture can potentially prevent early instabilities that cause failure in compression.

## Strain rate dependency of materials

The mechanical response of materials  can be affected by how fast the loads are applied, how quick deformation occurs. For instance, polymers tend to be stronger at higher speeds of deformation than at quasi-static regime due to their viscoelastic nature. In my research, I investigate how different materials behave at quasi-static and at  dynamic regimes. This information is later translated into mechanical models to help engineers to design real components.

## Ageing of composite materials
My research is oriented to the study of composite materials for underwater and aerospace applications. During service conditions these composites will be subjected to humid environments. My current investigation aims to develop a constitutive model able to capture the effects of water uptake upon the strain rate dependent properties of composites. Previously, in my master thesis, I investigated the degradation of fracture toughness of an epoxy resin due to hygrothermal aging.

## Development of novel experimental techniques
I like to be challenged by complex experimental setups. I have designed and built bespoke equipment (thermal chambers for in-situ testing) and experimental setups for micromechanical tests (micro compresion, tension and compact tension rigs). Currently, I am developing advanced in-situ tests for composites.

## Other research interests
- Constitutive modelling
- Instrumentation (LabView, sensors, Arduino)
